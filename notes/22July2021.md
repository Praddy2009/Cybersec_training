#### **"Please Do Not Throw Sausages, Pizza Away"**

**PDU: Protocol Data Unit**

-> Transport Layer:
	PDU: Segments
	three steps to be done
	1) Segment the data
	2) Give sequence number to data
	3) Assign Port

Que: Should use TCP or UDP?
 -> TCP (Transmission Control Protocol): 
 		-> Reliable transfer.
		-> 3 Way Handshake.
		-> If any packet is lost it will ask for it again.

-> UDP (User Datagram Protocol)
		-> Not Reliable
		-> It's Fast

### TCP 3 way Handshake

### Ports:
	Purpose: To enable the channel for communication.
	Total: 0 to 65535
	
	The port numbers are divided into three ranges: the _well-known ports_, the _registered ports_, and the _dynamic_ or _private ports_.

-> Network (Routers)

PDU : Packets
What device works here : **Routers**

Destination Mac: Next Device 


-> Physical Layer
 PDU is bits
 
 Device: ETHERNET CABLE, OPTIC Cable
